# Download and Usage

## Direct Use

The x64 version of Windows exe is available for direct use, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/geoyee/LabCD/releases/download/0.3/LabCD-0.3-x64-setup.exe). After downloading, follow the process to install. The packaging process is provided by [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/).

## Building and Use

1. Clone the project to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/geoyee/LabCD
```

1. Download and install [Qt 6.4.0](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer?hsCtaTracking=99d9dd4f-5681-48d2-b096-470725510d34|074ddad0-fdef-4e53-8aa8-5e8a876d6ab4) version according to your system. Windows users who want to use Visual Studio need to download the VS extension: Qt Visual Studio Tools.

2. Download the required dependencies. Currently, the required third-party packages are `OpenCV 4.5.5`, `JsonCpp 1.9.5`, `GDAL 3.5.3`, and `Eigen 3.4.0`.

   1. `OpenCV 4.5.5` can be downloaded from the official GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.5.5) and compiled using cmake.
   2. `JsonCpp 1.9.5` can be downloaded from the official GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/releases/tag/1.9.5) and compiled using cmake.
   3. `GDAL 3.5.3` can be downloaded from the official GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/releases/tag/v3.5.3) and compiled using cmake.
   4. `Eigen 3.4.0` can be downloaded directly from the official gitlab repository [here](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/tree/3.4.0).

   After preparing, you need to create a `depends` folder under the `labcd` folder, which includes `include` and `lib` folders. Put the completed include and lib files corresponding to Opencv, JsonCpp, and GDAL into the `depends` folder, and put the Eigen source code directly into `depends`. The `depends` folder structure after completion is as follows:

   ```
   luaCopy codedepends
      ├-- include
      |   ├-- gdal
      |   ├-- json
      |   └-- opencv2
      ├-- lib
      |   ├-- gdal_i.lib
      |   ├-- jsoncpp_static.lib
      |   ├-- jsoncpp_staticd.lib
      |   ├-- opencv_world455.lib
      |   └-- opencv_world455d.lib
      └-- Eigen
   ```

3. After completion, you can use Visual Studio to open the corresponding `sln` file for building or use Qt Creator to open the `pro` file, establish qmake and build, then you can use it.

4. The CMakeLists is generated by [qmake2cmake](https://www.qt.io/blog/introducing-qmake2cmake). If the paths of third-party dependencies change, whether it is Visual Studio, Qt Creator, or CMake, you need to adjust the paths of the dependencies.
